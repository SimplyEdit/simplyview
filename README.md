## Modern reactive web user interfaces the simply way

simplyview is a set of decoupled libraries to help build user interfaces for web applications. Each library is small and focused and can be used standalone. 

simplyview is build to be used in the browser. simplyview requires a modern browser, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge and others, but not Internet Explorer (although some parts do work in IE).

See the [reference](https://reference.simplyedit.io/simplyview/) for more information.
